      <h2>Detailed Recommendations</h2>

      <h3>Cymbidium</h3>
      <p>
        Cymbidiums have robust roots that benefit from a stable, wider pot. A pot with a near–1:1 or slightly wider ratio works well. Porous materials like terracotta offer excellent airflow. A substrate combining coarse orchid bark, perlite, and sphagnum moss ensures effective drainage while maintaining adequate moisture. For an adult plant, a pot around 25 cm in diameter by 20 cm in height is ideal.
      </p>

      <h3>Cambria</h3>
      <p>
        Though less frequently mentioned in orchid literature, Cambria care guidelines suggest using a balanced pot—roughly 1:1 or with a slightly taller profile to suit its root structure. Plastic pots are commonly used to maintain consistent moisture. The ideal substrate is a blend of fine-to-medium grade bark with perlite and a touch of sphagnum moss. According to <a href="https://secretgarden.ro/blogs/plant-care/cambria" target="_blank">Secret Garden</a>, an adult Cambria orchid performs best in a pot approximately 15 cm in diameter and 12 cm in height.
      </p>

      <h3>Miltonia</h3>
      <p>
        Often known as the pansy orchid, Miltonia prefers a moderately deep pot with balanced proportions (around 1:1 to 1:1.2). Plastic pots work well to manage moisture levels, while a substrate mix of fine orchid bark, perlite, and peat or sphagnum provides excellent drainage and moisture retention. For a mature plant, a pot around 15 cm in both diameter and height is recommended.
      </p>

      <h3>Cattleya</h3>
      <p>
        Cattleyas develop prominent pseudobulbs and benefit from low, wide pots—typically with a height-to-width ratio of about 0.8:1, meaning the pot is noticeably wider than it is tall. Both terracotta and plastic pots can be used; terracotta is especially favored for its breathability. Their substrate should consist of coarse orchid bark mixed with charcoal and perlite to ensure optimal drainage and aeration. An adult Cattleya usually thrives in a pot around 12–15 cm in diameter and about 10 cm in height.
      </p>

      <h3>Phalaenopsis</h3>
      <p>
        As one of the most popular orchids for beginners, Phalaenopsis is typically grown in small, shallow pots. Clear plastic pots allow for monitoring of the roots. The substrate is usually a mix of orchid bark combined with additives like coconut husk chips or sphagnum moss, striking the right balance between drainage and moisture retention. A mature Phalaenopsis often does best in a pot roughly 10–12 cm in diameter and 8–10 cm in height.
      </p>

      <h3>Vanda</h3>
      <p>
        Vanda orchids are unique among orchids as they are highly epiphytic and thrive with maximum air circulation. They are often grown mounted on slabs or in hanging baskets. If container-grown, Vandas benefit from a shallow pot or a specially designed net basket that allows free air movement around their aerial roots. The recommended pot should have a low height-to-width ratio, with minimal substrate – typically just a coarse mix of bark pieces or tree fern fiber to provide a bit of support while ensuring rapid drainage. For an adult Vanda, a container with approximate dimensions of 20 cm in diameter and 8–10 cm in height works well.
